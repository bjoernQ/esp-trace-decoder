# esp-trace-decoder

This is a decoder for traces generated by the ESP32-C6's / ESP32-H2's RISCV TRACE Encoder.

## Usage

Execute one of the examples (`cargo run --release`). Then copy the dumped trace data and save it as a file.

Make sure you have access to the ROM ELF files (https://github.com/espressif/esp-rom-elfs) because in order to decode the trace data we need access to all the traced instructions.

Run the decoder like this:
`cargo run -- YOUR_SAVED_TRACE --elf example-esp32h2\target\riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf\release\example-esp32h2 --elf PATH_TO_ROM_ELF\esp32h2_rev0_rom.elf`

Then you should see the decoded execution path.
